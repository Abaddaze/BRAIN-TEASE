Introduction
Project Name: Brain Tease
Purpose: To create an engaging and educational quiz game.
Team Members: Hicham (Solo Project)
Timeline: July 4, 2024 - July 11, 2024
Target Audience: Students and trivia enthusiasts looking to test and improve their knowledge.
Personal Focus: My primary focus was on developing an intuitive user interface and ensuring the quiz logic was robust and challenging.

Why I Chose This Project
I have always enjoyed quizzes and trivia games, finding them a fun way to learn new things and challenge my mind. Growing up, I would spend hours playing quiz games with friends and family, always striving to improve my knowledge. This project was a perfect opportunity to combine my love for quizzes with my passion for coding. I aimed to create a game that not only entertains but also educates its players.

Accomplishments
Result Summary
Brain Tease is a fully functional quiz game that challenges users with a variety of questions across different categories. The game keeps track of the user’s score and provides feedback on their performance.
Technologies Used
HTML5 and CSS3: For structuring and styling the game interface.
JavaScript: For implementing the quiz logic and handling user interactions.
We opted to use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any additional frameworks to solidify our understanding of these core technologies.
Key Features
Dynamic Question Loading: Questions are loaded dynamically from a JSON file, allowing for easy updates and additions.
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the user’s score and displays it at the end of the quiz.
Responsive Design: The game is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

The Most Difficult Technical Challenge
Situation
One of the most challenging aspects of developing Brain Tease was ensuring that the game logic correctly handled all possible user interactions.
Task
I needed to ensure that the quiz game accurately tracked the user’s progress and provided immediate feedback for each answer.
Action
I implemented a robust event-handling system using JavaScript. This involved creating functions to handle different user actions, such as selecting an answer and moving to the next question. I also had to ensure that the score was updated correctly and that the feedback was displayed immediately.
Result
After several rounds of testing and debugging, the game logic worked seamlessly. Users could now enjoy a smooth and responsive quiz experience, with accurate score tracking and immediate feedback on their answers.

What I've Learned
Technical Takeaways
Deepened my understanding of JavaScript event handling and DOM manipulation.
Gained experience in designing and implementing responsive web applications.
Reflections
If I were to do this project again, I might consider using a front-end framework like React to manage the state more efficiently. I also learned that thorough testing is crucial to ensure the reliability of the application.
Personal Growth
This project has reinforced my problem-solving skills and my ability to learn and adapt to new challenges. It has also solidified my passion for web development and my desire to continue growing as a software engineer.
